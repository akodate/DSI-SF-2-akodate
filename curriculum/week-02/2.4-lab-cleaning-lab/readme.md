By this point, you should be comfortable working with Python, and begining to familliarize yourself with Pandas.  For this exersize, you will be building your data analysis pipeline from the ground up.  In your own local git repo, start by creating a new notebook using the "dsi" kernel.

#### Requirements:  Rock Songs

Create a new notebook 
- Load the dataset from the `datasets` folder labeled `datasets/rock_songs`
- Rename the columns to something more descriptive
- Print the summary stats: mean, median, mode, std, variance, range
  - Release Year
  - First
  - Year
  - Play Count
  - F*G
- Clean / convert / normalize any problematic variables that can't be summarized.

##### Questions
**1. What are the top 20 most popular songs by plays?**

**2. Which years have the most plays?**

**3. Which records don't have matching "Play Count" cooresponding to "F*G"?**

**Bonus: Which artists have the most misssing values between each of the variables? ** 


#### Bonus Requirements:  Highest Paid Athletes
In your existing notebook
- Load the dataset from the `datasets` folder for `highest_paid_athletes`
- Rename any columns
- Print the summary stats: mean, median, mode, std, variance, range
  - Total Pay
  - Salary/Winnings
  - Endorsements
  - Birthdates
  - Height
- Clean / convert / normalize any problematic variables that can't be summarized.

##### Bonus Questions

**3. Who's making more on endorsements than salary?**

**4. For #3, Is this more common in some sports more than others?**
