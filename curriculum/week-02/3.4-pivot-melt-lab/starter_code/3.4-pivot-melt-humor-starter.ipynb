    "# 3.4 Lab: Practice \"long\" and \"wide\" data formats\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we are going to practice going between long and wide formats using pandas, and go deeper into the possibilites and options with melt, pivot_tables, and hierarchical indices than we covered in the lesson!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that **long format** has:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Potentially multiple \"id\" (identification) columns.\n",
    "- Variable:value column pairs that match a variable key to a value (in the simple case, a single variable column and a single value column).\n",
    "- The \"variable\" column corresponds to the multiple variable columns in your wide format data. Now, instead of a column for each variable, you have a row for each variable:value pair, per id. \n",
    "- This is a standard format in SQL databases because it is appropriate for joining different tables together by keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "And **wide format:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are multiple ID _and_ value columns. In other words, there is a column for every \"variable\" with its own unique values.\n",
    "- The format has both the conceptual simplicity of a single column of values per variable and a more compact matrix.\n",
    "- Is not useful for SQL-style operations: it can make it much harder or even impossible to join tables together on a value.\n",
    "- Can be more useful in pandas when you need to preform operations on variables **across columns**. For example, multiplying columns together.\n",
    "- It is the most commonly the format that you will put the data in when you are ready to perform modeling (with some exceptions). When we get into modeling next week I will explain why.\n",

    "27. If I don't like someone, I often use humor or teasing to put them down.\n",
    "28. If I am having problems or feeling unhappy, I often cover it up by joking around, so that even my closest friends don't know how I really feel.\n",
    "29. I usually can't think of witty things to say when I'm with other people.\n",
    "30. I don't need to be with other people to feel amused. I can usually find things to laugh about even when I'm by myself.\n",
    "31. Even if something is really funny to me, I will not laugh or joke about it if someone will be offended.\n",

People's values for these attributes are closer together, on average (but keep in mind this might just be because the range is \"shrunk\", which is why it is important to look at both and plot.
