    "1. Load and clean, if neccessary, the data with pandas.\n",
    "2. Identify variables and subsets of the data your are interested in as a group.\n",
    "2. Describe the data and investigate any outliers for those variables.\n",
    "3. Explore relationships between variables.\n",
    "4. Visualize at least three variables of your choice with appropriate visualizations. They should be readable.\n",
    "5. Visualize subsets of the variables you chose, subsetted conditional on some other variable. For example, number of customer service calls by churn rate.\n",
    "6. Write a brief report on at least 5 things you found interesting about the data or, if it doesn't interest you at all, things you found out and why they are boring."
