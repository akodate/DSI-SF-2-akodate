    "For these challenges, you will need to have a basic working knowledge of Python and be comfortable with fundamental usage. To get the most out of these exercises you should avoid using libraries (but feel free to use buil-in types ie: zip()) as much as possible and try to construct solutions by hand as much as possible. Also, if solutions are available, try not to peek to get the most out of this.\n",

Given a list of mixed type list elements, organize the output in a dictionary by their respective types as keys, and values as literal values.

You will always have a case were you will need to munge data that your tools can't.  Many tools provide you with the ability to plug your own code in (such as Pandas .map .apply or .filter, or other toolsets that provide methods that allow for private functions or user defined functions to select and manipulate data).  It's good practice to learn how to think about these problems from the fundamental cases, outside your toolset using native Python.\n",
