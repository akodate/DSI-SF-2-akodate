    "# Alternate Code Challenges #1\n",
    "\n",
    "While the rest of the class learns about types, you've already known about types and have at least a basic level of experience working with Python.  We think there are plenty of algorithms and data structures that are important to know about, which are outside the scope of our class but fall under year 1-2 computer science fundamentals.  However, with these alternate exercises, we feel are at least somehow supportive of what you might find in job interviews and Python code challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are completely **optional**, but if you are unable to complete these in the beginning, come back to them once you're ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "For these challenges, you will need to have a basic working knowledge of Python and be comfortable with fundamental usage.  To get the most out of these exercises you should avoid using libraries (but feel free to use buil-in types ie: zip()) as much as possible and try to construct solutions by hand as much as possible.  Also, if solutions are available, try not to peek to get the most out of this.  \n",
