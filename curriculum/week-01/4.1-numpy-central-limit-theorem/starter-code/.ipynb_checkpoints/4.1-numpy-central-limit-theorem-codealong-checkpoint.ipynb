    "These are the essential kinds of operations we'll be using. The main takeaway is to get used to these kind of **vectorized** operations: doing arithmetic operations on every element of an array, either with single values or element-wise with another array.  **Masking** operations will become extremely important tools as we move into pandas data manipulation.\n",

    "### 6. The Central Limit Theorem and the Law of Large Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is one of the most important, if not **THE** most important theorems in statistics. While this lecture does not cover the implications so much as the theorem itself, know that this is the basis of Frequentist statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.1 The Law of Large Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "But first... [The Law of Large Numbers (LLN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLN is (luckily) fairly straightforward, and a precursor to understanding the CLT. My simplified definition is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Performing the same experiment a large number of times and taking the average of the results will result in a convergence to the true expected value of the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine, for example, you were to roll a die two times. In this case, the die is weighted, but you don't know how it is weighted. You get a 1 and a 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "From just these two experiments, our average is 3.0. If we were to stop here, we would assume that the expected value of the die is 3.0, and so slightly biased towards smaller numbers...\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.2 Numpy's `random` module and exploration of the LLN\n",
    "\n",
    "Before continuing, let's introduce a very important section of `numpy`: the `np.random` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is _very_ much worth reading over the documentation for the different functions available in `numpy.random`. Randomness is intrinsic to statistical theory, and, especially in a statistical course, we will be using it often.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's not to say you _won't_ be using it in practice. I guarantee that you will be consistently returning to these functions in your future jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example of the LLN, we will be using `np.random.choice()`, a function that samples from a provided array or list of elements. The arguments are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a : the array from which to choose elements\n",
    "    size : the number of elements to draw\n",
    "    replace : whether to sample with replacement\n",
    "    p : a vector of probabilities equal to the number of elements in a which sums to one, specifying the probability of drawing the elements\n",
    "    \n",
    "Below are the _true_ probabilities of drawing each number on the die, or in other words the true weighting of the die:"
