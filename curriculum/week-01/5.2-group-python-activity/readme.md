- Explain if, if/else, and if/elif/else statements and use them in your code
- Explain why control flow is important
- Explain what a function is and cases where they are useful

### INSTRUCTOR PREP
*Before this lesson, instructors will need to:*
- Review what students have done to this point and identify weaknesses that may need more attention

<a name="Control Flow and Python Review"></a>
## Opening and Review (5 mins)

Over the last few days we've gone over quite a bit of python.

- Integers, floats, strings
- Arithmetic operators, string operators
- Variable assignment
- Lists and dictionaries, operations on both
- If, if/else, loops, functions
- Iteration, libraries

There are 9 exercises in iPython notebooks within the starter-code folder to help you review and challenge your python coding abilities. They vary in difficulty. Hard problems are identified in the header.

<a name="ind-practice"></a>
## Independent Practice: Topic (35-40 mins)

Pair up into groups of two to tackle one of the exercises. If you complete your assigned exercise, trying completing another one (or at least getting started on it).


<a name="exercise-overview"></a>
## Overview of Exercises (40-45 minutes)

Look over exercises that are of particular interest or that gave people trouble.


<a name="conclusion"></a>
## Conclusion (5 mins)
Take a breather. You've learned a lot the last few days and you've applied it. Well done. Onwards!
