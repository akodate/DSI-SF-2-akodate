    "In this more detailed codealong/lab we are going to practice PCA. \n",
    "\n",
    "Considering how often people use PCA to simplify their data, reduce noise in their data, and find unmeasured \"latent variables\", it is important to spend the time to understand what's going on.\n",

    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we are using for this lab is a subset of the [much more detailed speed dating dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment). In particular, this contains no information on the actual speed dating itself (successes with or opinions of other individuals). It also contains no \"follow-up\" information where individuals are re-asked the same questions about themselves. All it contains are things that an individual enjoys doing, their ratings of themselves on how desireable they are, and how they think others rate them on desireability.\n",

    "Specifically, the columns in the data are outlined below:\n",
