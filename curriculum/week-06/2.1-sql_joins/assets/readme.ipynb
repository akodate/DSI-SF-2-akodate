    "### Normalized vs Denormalized data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to organize data in a relational database. Two common definitions for data setups are: _normalized_ and _denormalized_.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Normalized_ structures have a single table per entity, and use many foreign keys or link tables to connect the entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Denormalized tables_ have fewer tables and may (for example) place all of the tweets and the information on users in one table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each style has advantages and disadvantages. _Denormalized_ tables duplicate a lot of information. For example, in our combined tweets/users table, we may store the address of each user. Now instead of storing this once per user, we are storing this once per tweet!  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this makes the data easy to access if we ever need to find the tweet along with the user's location.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Normalized_ tables save the storage space by separating the information. However, if we ever need to access those two pieces of information, we would need to _join_ the two tables, which can be a fairly slow operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check:** Are the three tables above Normalized or Denormalized?\n",
    "> Answer: Normalized\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check:** Can you make an example of a de-normalized table derived from the ones above?\n",

    "### Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "_SQL joins_ are used when data is spread in different tables. A _join_ operation allows to combine rows from two or more tables in a single new table. In order for this to be possible, a common field between the tables need to exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check:** where have you encountered a similar functionality in Pandas?\n",
    "> Answer:  `merge` function in Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check:** can you make a couple of examples of how you used that Pandas function in the past?\n",
    "\n",
    "Join operations can be thought of as operations between two sets, where records with the same key are combined and records missing in one set are either discarded or included as NULL values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### INNER JOIN\n",
    "The most common type of join is: SQL INNER JOIN (simple join). An SQL INNER JOIN returns all rows from multiple tables where the join condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a few columns of the `orders` table above:\n",
    "\n",
    "|OrderID|CustomerID|OrderDate|\n",

    "|2|Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados|Ana Trujillo|Mexico|\n",
    "|3|Antonio Moreno Taquería|Antonio Moreno|Mexico|\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the `CustomerID` column in the `Orders` table refers to the `CustomerID` in the `Customers` table. The relationship between the two tables above is the `CustomerID` column. We can thus _JOIN_ the two tables in order to obtain a table like the following:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Where the information contained in the two tables is _joined_ in a single table, using the common key of `CustomerID`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check:** Restate in your own words what a `JOIN` operation is?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check:** Think back to what you've learned about _normalized_ and _non-normalized_ databases. In which case are `joins` more likely to be necessary?\n",

    "\n",
    "See [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/comparison_with_sql.html) for a comparison between pandas and SQL and [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/merging.html#database-style-dataframe-joining-merging) for an in depth review of Pandas merge."
