    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will further explore Scikit's and NLTK's capabilities to process text. We will use the [20 Newsgroup dataset](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/), which is provided by Scikit-Learn. This is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups. The 20 newsgroups collection has become a popular data set for experiments in text applications of machine learning techniques, such as text classification and text clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will restrict the analysis to 4 groups and will attempt to classify them starting from the corresponding text.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a typical example of text classification, where a data scientist's task is to train a model that can partition text in pre-defined categories. Other examples include sentiment analysis and topic assignment."
