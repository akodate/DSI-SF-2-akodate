    "Today we will break into groups to look at the global data science job market from indeed.  You will be extending the work on an existing spider project and working with NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following insights are required from all Groups:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Top hiring companies\n",
    " - Counts of \"skill\" keywords (ie: Statistics, Python, Machine Learning, Big Data, etc)\n",
    " - Prediction of \"data scientists\" job titles against job titles not labeled \"data scientist\"\n",
    "   - Capture the probability predictions of your model, put it back in your dataframe, sort to see top predicted jobs that are not labeld \"data scientist\".  Further extend your analsysis from here to see which are most common or most likely.  What are the insights from this?\n",
    " \n",
    "BONUS:\n",
    " - Perform LDA on job summaries.\n",
    " \n",
    "Advice:\n",
    " - Create a feature that takes the value 0 or 1 if the title is \"Data Scientist\".\n",
    " - Develop an xpath feature that extracts the company name in the spider.\n",
    " - Set your DOWNLOAD_DELAY in your settings.py file to 4 and debug your queries 1st.  Then remove the delay once you want to scrape the whole site.\n",
    " - Use CountVectorizer, and compare with TFIDFVectorizer\n",
    " - Vectorize the summary as your X, and the 0 / 1 feature from your dataframe as your **y**\n",
    " - LogisticRegression is a good place to start with modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this spider to start your analysis.  Be mindful of the rate default in your settings file!\n",
