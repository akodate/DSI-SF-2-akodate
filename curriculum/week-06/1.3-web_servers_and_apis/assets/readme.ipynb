    "In the previous class we learned about decision trees. We now open a parentheses to learn about the very important topic of APIs. An API (application program interface) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. It specifies how software components should interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of data science, APIs are a very important method to interact with data hosted by third parties. We can consider APIs as a way to interact with someonelse's database."

    "<a name=\"introduction\"></a>\n",
    "## Introduction (15 min)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to talk about APIs, we need first to introduce the _separation of concerns_. In computer science, _separation of concerns_ (SoC) is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate concern. A concern is a set of informations that affects the code of a computer program. In particular, when building a web application, it's best practice to separate the website logic from data models. This not only allows for cleaner code, but is an easier way to manipulate our layouts and interactions. Separation of concerns becomes ever more important when working with outside data.\n",
    "\n",
    "API calls are really a fancy term for making _HTTP requests_ to a server and sending/receiving structured data from that endpoint. We are still communicating with URLs, however instead of receiving markup, like we do with HTML pages, we receive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Representational state transfer (REST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) is the most common architecture style for passing information to and from these API endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start consuming these services however, it's important to understand the fundamentals of the underlying communication layer: HTTP.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTTP: Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP is a protocol - a system of rules - that determines how web pages (see:'hypertext') get sent (see:'transferred') from one place to another. Among other things, it defines the format of the messages passed between HTTP clients and HTTP servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Web Architecture](./assets/images/webserver_to_rails_setup.jpeg \"Web Architecture\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the web is a service, it works through a combination of clients which _make_ requests and servers (which _receive_ requests).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HTTP Client\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP Clients make or generate HTTP Requests. Some types of clients are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Browsers - Chrome, Firefox and Safari.\n",
    "* Command Line programs - [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/) and [wget](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP Clients respond to HTTP Responses from a Web Server. They process the data being returned form a Web Server, aka HTTP Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HTTP/Web Server\n",
    "\n",
    "All _Web Servers_ receive _HTTP Requests_ and generate _HTTP Responses_. Often Web Servers are just the middleman, passing HTTP Request and Responses between the client and web application. Two of the most popular _HTTP or Web servers_ are [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/) and [Nginx](http://nginx.com/), But there are lots different [web servers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_server_software) out there.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Web Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Web Applications are programs that run on a web server, process the HTTP requests that the server receives, and generate HTTP Responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "![HTTP Request and Response](./assets/images/http_req_resp.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lost? Here's the play-by-play.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A client sends a HTTP Request to a HTTP Server running on a remote machine.  \n",
    "  * The _hostname_ given in the URL, indicates which server will receive the request.  \n",
    "2. The HTTP server processes the HTTP Request. This may entail passing the request to some Web Application, which creates a HTTP Response.\n",
    "3. The response gets sent back to the client.\n",
    "4. The client processes the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does the server know what the request is asking for? This is specified by the URL, a special kind of path that specifies where a resource can be found on the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "![URL](./assets/images/http1-url-structure.png)\n",

    "JSON is short for _JavaScript Object Notation_, and is a way to store information in an organized, easy-to-access manner. In a nutshell, it gives us a human-readable collection of data that we can access in a really logical manner.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, structure, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.\n",
    "* An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is an unordered set of name/value pairs, like python dictionaries. An object begins with `{` (left brace) and ends with `}` (right brace). Each name is followed by `:` (colon) and the name/value pairs are separated by `,` (comma).\n",
