    "In order to talk about APIs, we need first to introduce the _separation of concerns_. In computer science, _separation of concerns_ (SoC) is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate concern. A concern is a set of informations that affects the code of a computer program. In particular, when building a web application, it's best practice to separate the website logic from data models. This not only allows for cleaner code, but is an easier way to manipulate our layouts and interactions. Separation of concerns becomes ever more important when working with outside data.\n",
