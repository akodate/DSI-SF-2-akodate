    "_Amazon Web Services (AWS)_, is a subsidiary of Amazon.com, which offers a suite of cloud computing services that make up an on-demand computing platform. These services operate from 12 geographical regions across the world. The most central and best-known of these services arguably include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, also known as \"EC2\", and Amazon Simple Storage Service, also known as \"S3\". **AWS now has more than 70 services that span a wide range including compute, storage, networking, database, analytics, application services, deployment, management, mobile, developer tools and tools for the Internet of things.** Amazon markets AWS as a service to provide large computing capacity quicker and cheaper than a client company building an actual physical server farm. _(from wikipedia)_\n",
