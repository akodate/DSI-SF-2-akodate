    "Divide and conquer strategy is a fundamental algorithmic technique for solving a given task, whose steps include:\n",

    "1. split task into subtasks\n",
    "- solve these subtasks independently\n",
    "- recombine the subtask results into a final result\n",

    "\n",
    "### Map-Reduce\n",
    "\n",
    "The term _Map Reduce_ indicate a two-phase divide and conquer algorithm initially invented and publicized by Google in 2004. It involves splitting a problem into subtasks and processing these subtasks in parallel and it consists of two phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the mapper phase\n",
    "- the reducer phase\n",
    "\n",
    "In the _mapper phase_, data is split into chunks and the same computation is performed on each chunk, while in the _reducer phase_, data is aggregated back to produce a final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Map-reduce uses a functional programming paradigm. The data processing primitives are mappers and reducers, as we’ve seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "- mappers – filter & transform data\n",
    "- reducers – aggregate results\n",

    "\n",
    "When data is really large we will distribute it to several mappers running on different machines. Sending a long list of `(word, 1)` pairs to the reducer node is not efficient.
