    "In the past lab we've used a Virtual Machine to run Map Reduce jobs on native hadoop. As you may have understood, it's quite cumbersome and complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily we don't have to do that, because our friends at Yelp developed a great open source python library that wraps around hadoop streaming called [MRJob](https://github.com/Yelp/mrjob).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is already installed in your VM, but you can also install it locally if you prefer, using:\n",

    "`pip install mrjob`."

    "## MRJob\n",
    "\n",
    "While Hadoop streaming is a simple way to do simple map-reduce tasks, it's complicated to use and not really friendly when things fail and we have to debug our code. Also, if we wanted to do a join from two different sets of data, it would be complicate to handle both with a single mapper, while it'd be much easier to have two separate mappers and one reducer.\n",
    "\n",
    "_MRJob_ is a library written and maintained by YELP that allows us to write map reduce jobs in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the word count map reduce, rewritten using MRJob.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> Notice the use of `%%file` magic command.  This will write a file called \"wordcount.py\" into the same directory as this notebook.  Then you can run this file from shell `python wordcount.py counts.tsv` or transfer it over to the VM and run it.  We may go over how to access the VM on in class and how to transfer the code over as we work on this together."
