    "Apache Spark is an open source cluster computing framework. Originally developed at the University of California, Berkeley's AMPLab, the Spark codebase was later donated to the Apache Software Foundation that has maintained it since. Spark provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault-tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark has gained traction over the past few years because of its superior performace with respect to Hadoop-MapReduce. In fact, Spark was developed in response to limitations in the MapReduce cluster computing paradigm. By now you should be familiar with MapReduce. In MapReduce data is read from disk and then a function is mapped across the data. Then the reducer will reduce the results of the map and finally store reduction results back to HDFS. \n",
    "\n",
    "Spark relaxes the constraints of MR by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- generalizes computation from Map/Reduce only graphs to arbitrary Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)\n",
    "- removes a lot of boilerplate code present in Hadoop\n",
    "- allows to \"tweak\" parts that in Hadoop are not accessible, like for example the sort algorithm\n",
    "- allows to load data in a cluster memory, speeding up I/O enormously\n",
    "\n",
    "The two pillars on which Spark is based are RDDs and DAGs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Apache Spark provides programmers with an application programming interface centered on a data structure called the _resilient distributed dataset (RDD)_, a read-only multiset of data items distributed over a cluster of machines, that is maintained in a fault-tolerant way. Spark's RDDs function as a working set for distributed programs that offers a (deliberately) restricted form of distributed shared memory. In other words, Spark is keeping the data in memory, instead of on disk, thus making it easier to implement both iterative algorithms, that visit their dataset multiple times in a loop, and interactive/exploratory data analysis, i.e., the repeated database-style querying of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The latency of such applications (compared to Apache Hadoop, a popular MapReduce implementation) may be reduced by several orders of magnitude with this approach. Among the class of iterative algorithms are the training algorithms for machine learning systems, which formed the initial impetus for developing Apache Spark. In other words, with Spark we are able to perform Machine Learning at Big Data scale!\n",
    "\n",
    "Apache Spark requires a cluster manager and a distributed storage system. For cluster management, Spark supports standalone (native Spark cluster), Hadoop YARN, or Apache Mesos. For distributed storage, Spark can interface with a wide variety, including Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), MapR File System (MapR-FS), Cassandra, OpenStack Swift, Amazon S3, Kudu, or a custom solution can be implemented. Spark also supports a pseudo-distributed local mode, usually used only for development or testing purposes, where distributed storage is not required and the local file system can be used instead; in such a scenario, Spark is run on a single machine with one executor per CPU core. This is how we will use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Directed Acyclic Graph?\n",
    "DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) is a programming style for distributed systems - You can think of it as an alternative to Map Reduce. While MR has just two steps (map and reduce), DAG can have multiple levels that can form a tree structure. Say if you want to execute a SQL query, DAG is more flexible with more functions like map, filter, union etc. Each node in the graph represent a particular operation on the data. The graph is _Directed_, meaning the information only flows in one direction along the edges and it cannot flow backwards. This is makes the identification of inputs and outputs easy and unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "![DAG](./assets/images/dag.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will see Spark is smart in how it performs the calculation along the DAG.\n",

    "The Spark Core is the foundation of the overall project. It provides distributed task dispatching, scheduling, and basic I/O functionalities, exposed through an application programming interface (for Java, Python, Scala, and R) centered on the RDD abstraction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the operations offered by the Spark API:\n",
    "\n",
    "- map\n",
    "- filter\n",

    "![](./assets/images/spark-flow.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Spark Variables\n",
    "Spark provides two forms of shared variables:\n",
    "- broadcast variables: they reference read-only data that needs to be available on all nodes\n",
    "- accumulators: they can be used to program reductions in an imperative style\n",

    "- Actions: these are \"non-lazy\" operations that immediately return a result\n",

    "- **Spark Core:** Contains the basic functionality of Spark; in particular the APIs that define RDDs and the operations and actions that can be undertaken upon them. The rest of Spark's libraries are built on top of the RDD and Spark Core.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spark SQL:** Provides APIs for interacting with Spark via the Apache Hive variant of SQL called Hive Query Language (HiveQL). Every database table is represented as an RDD and Spark SQL queries are transformed into Spark operations. For those that are familiar with Hive and HiveQL, Spark can act as a drop-in replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spark Streaming:** Enables the processing and manipulation of live streams of data in real time. Many streaming data libraries (such as Apache Storm) exist for handling real-time data. Spark Streaming enables programs to leverage this data similar to how you would interact with a normal RDD as data is flowing in.\n",

    "- **MLlib:** A library of common machine learning algorithms implemented as Spark operations on RDDs. This library contains scalable learning algorithms like classifications, regressions, etc. that require iterative operations across large data sets. The Mahout library, formerly the Big Data machine learning library of choice, will move to Spark for its implementations in the future.\n",
